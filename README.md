## Team Members: Damian Rene, Gabe Hines, Jaron Tinsley

### Project Purpose:

Note-taking has always been a solo task. You sit in class by yourself writing as fast as you can. While this can work, whatever there was an easier way to have more comprehensive notes? Meet Ascribe! Ascribe is the all in one open source collaborative note-taking solution. Share your notes with any other user of the app with a click of a button. Notes can be organized into folders or "boards" as we call them for ease of use and boards or individual notes can be shared with classmates to take notes together in realtime. After you have taken notes together, view our AI powered summaries of your boards and documents which give you a better overview of the information you just gathered together! Help us be the future of note-taking!
